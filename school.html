<h1>Cerritos College</h1>
<p>
    I started attending <a href="https://www.cerritos.edu/">Cerritos College</a> in the fall of 2021. It was the start of 
    Freshman year in college. I had already heard a lot of things about college being 
    hard. And being the step to been taken to land a high-paying job or to pursue your 
    own career. I had a lot of expectations set up for college, some being from people 
    who previously attended college themselves, while others being from those that didn't 
    emphasize the difficulty, when hearing about the topics and how extensively the 
    classes get taught. However, when I did finally attend college, I found the 
    expectations that I set for myself to be meaningless and overexaggerated.
