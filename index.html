<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am Nirmal Subedi, a student in CIS 162. I started attending cerritos 
during fall of 2021. I find it interesting that the college is known as 
the home of the falcons because it shares the same mascot as my Middle School, a "falcon". 
During middle school, I was considering pursuing a career related in technology. 
So, I am majoring in Computer Science and hoping to be able to develop a career in this field.</p>
